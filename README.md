# 🧠 DSA Practice in Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo is a personal log of my daily DSA problem-solving journey using **Java**. I created it to:
- Stay consistent with practice
- Track my growth over time
- Help others preparing for technical interviews 🚀

---

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

- ✅ **Daily Java solutions** to a wide range of DSA problems
- 📂 Organized folders by topic and difficulty
- 📘 Clean, beginner-friendly code with comments
- 📊 A well-defined roadmap for interview prep
- 📁 A complete DSA tracker Excel sheet with **direct links** to every problem

---

## 📄 DSA Roadmap Tracker (Excel)

This repo contains a file named **`DSA.xlsx`**, which includes:
- ✅ The **entire 250-question roadmap**
- 🔗 **Direct clickable links** to each problem
- 📈 Real-time tracking of solved vs pending
- 💡 Use this sheet to follow along or customize your own journey

### 🟣 Miscellaneous DSA (25 Questions)
These topics are often asked by companies like Codenation, Google, or in high-level contests.

- Bit Manipulation (7)
- String Algorithms (5)
- Segment Tree (6)
- Number Theory (5)
- DP with Trees (2)

---

## 🔁 Daily Revision Strategy

Once I complete **30 questions**, I’ll start a **daily revision habit**:
- Revise **3 previously solved problems per day**
- Helps reinforce concepts and retain logic for interviews

---

## 💡 How to Use

If you're preparing for coding interviews:

1. Browse through folders or search by topic
2. Review the problem statement (in comments or linked)
3. Read the Java code and logic
4. Try solving it on your own before checking the solution

You can also **fork** this repo and track your own progress using the same roadmap!

---

## 📅 Daily Commitment

I aim to solve and commit at least **1 DSA problem a day**  
Check the commit history to see my consistency 💪

## 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily my personal journey, but feel free to:
- Raise issues or suggest improvements
- Share your own solutions or optimizations
